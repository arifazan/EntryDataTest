# EntryDataTest

A Simple Web application for practicing Login Validation, and DB Connection
technology used are HTML, PHP, SQL Server and Docker
HTML used for the form to be used as the login screen and data entry, this is done without any changes on the design aspect since it is not the main purpose for this practice.
PHP supposedly be used as the back end of the web application, relaying data from the HTML form to the database by executing Stored Procedure within the database.
SQL Server used for the database purpose. 2 Table was created for login and the data entry as well as the necessary procedure linked to it.
Docker is the part of the technology that becomes the main idea for practice. 

Xubuntu used for development progress

however there are problems encountered during the development up until now


Problems as of 09/01/2021:
- This is my first time using docker so there are many terminal command that needs to be learned
- Unable to connect PHP and DB within docker. this made testing the queary from the PHP far more difficult
- Docker seemingly to close connection between db and Visual Studio Code.
- Still searching for exporting either the DB within the docker or the Docker Container itself
